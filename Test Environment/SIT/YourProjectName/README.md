# Robot Framework on macOS

## Introduction

Robot Framework is a generic test automation framework for acceptance testing and other test types. It utilizes a keyword-driven testing methodology and supports behaviors driven development (BDD). Robot Framework's main strengths are its easy-to-use syntax, flexibility, and support for multiple platforms.

```

## Creating a Robot Framework Project

1. Create a project directory to hold your test cases and other project files.
2. Navigate to the project directory using Terminal.
3. Create a new file named `test.robot` to store your Robot Framework test cases.
4. Create a file named `requirements.txt` to list the Robot Framework libraries you need to install.

### Installing Robot Framework Libraries

5. Install the required Robot Framework libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running Robot Framework Tests

Execute the test cases in the test.robot file using the following command:

```bash
robot test.robot
```
